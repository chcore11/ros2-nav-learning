\# 2026-02-28 (Day1–Day2)



\## What I did

\- Set up Git for Windows and Git Bash

\- Created a public GitHub repo: ros2-nav-learning

\- Configured Clash proxy for Git (127.0.0.1:7897) and cloned repo successfully

\- Learned Git workflow: add / commit / push

\- Updated README and pushed changes to GitHub

\- Initialized project folders (docs / logs / assets / screenshots / workspace / scripts)



\## Issues / Fix

\- `fatal: not a git repository` → fixed by `cd` into the repo folder

\- Typo `git add.` → correct is `git add .`

\- `git commit` opened COMMIT\_EDITMSG editor → write message, save, close

\- Accidentally created an untracked file `main` → removed with `rm main`

\- `Everything up-to-date` → means local and remote are synced



\## Next

\- Add `.gitignore`

\- Upgrade README to internship-ready project homepage

\- Decide environment: Ubuntu (WSL/VM) + ROS2 distro
